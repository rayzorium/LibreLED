# LibreLED
A collection of lighting effects for WS2812B-controlled LEDs, to be used with FastLED and Arduino. Asus Aura compatible.

Version 1.0
* Basic UI done.
* Color Cycle done.
* Replicates Asus Aura lighting pattern on motherboard on a ws2812B strip. Repeats if strip has more total zones than the motherboard.


Coming soon:
* Conversion of Will Yager's music visualizer for use with FastLED.

NOTE: I've taken this down as its current state isn't up to my standards, sorry! It'll be back up in a few weeks, so stay tuned!
